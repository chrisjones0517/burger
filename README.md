# Eat Da Burger!
A Burger Eatin' Application with Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars/Bootstrap
## Description
This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and styling from the Bootstrap framework, and the backend implemented using Node.js and Express. The templating for HTML is accomplished by using Handlebars.

The user is instructed to enter a burger name and then click "Submit" to add it to the menu. This user entry also gets added to the mySQL database, thus providing persistent data. The initial burger entry is populated into the "available" column at the left side of the screen. The user may then "eat" any burger by clicking the corresponding "DEVOUR IT button, which populates changes in the database, redirects the view to the initial state, which then reads, sorts, and displays the data according to the stored boolean value in the database. The now "eaten" burger will be displayed in the "devoured" column on the right.
